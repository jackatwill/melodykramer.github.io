In February 2015, NPR's Danny Zwerdling published a four-part investigative series on [nurses who had been injured on the job ](http://www.npr.org/series/385540559/injured-nurses). The series was published on the NPR website and distributed using NPR's API to member station [websites](http://iowapublicradio.org/post/va-hospitals-training-and-technology-reduce-nurses-injuries).

On the NPR homepage, Danny's investigative work was given the same treatment as other NPR and member station pieces published on the same day. What this means is that a quick news spot from [The Two-Way](http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/) or a human interest piece [on ice sculptures](http://www.npr.org/2015/02/11/385464643/wisconsin-sculptor-rebuilds-after-60-foot-ice-sculpture-collapses) appeared on the NPR homepage for roughly the same length of time as Danny's work, which took [over a year](https://www.facebook.com/NPR/posts/10202459442581038) to put together. If you took a glance at the NPR homepage several days later, you were likely to miss Danny's work altogether.

NPR does have an API but it [stipulates](http://www.npr.org/api/index) that use is for "personal, non-commercial use, or for noncommercial online use by a nonprofit corporation which is exempt from federal income taxes under Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code."

This means Danny's lengthy investigation could not be published by a for-profit alternative weekly or by a nursing organization. It could not be picked up by a wire service or distributed by a foreign news organization.

I was thinking about Danny's piece when I saw that ProPublica encourages anyone to [steal its stories](http://www.propublica.org/nerds/item/happy-birthday-creative-commons), which are published under a Creative Commons license and frequently [picked up](http://www.altweeklies.com/aan/creative-commons-ftw-how-alt-weeklies-are-using-propublica-content-for-free/Article?oid=6490956) by other publications. As Richard Tofel and Scott Klein write:

> In the last year, republication of ProPublica stories under our CC license has increased dramatically. Through November, we’ve recorded more than 4.2 million page views this year for authorized reprints of our work, which is up 77 percent over the same period in 2011, and is the equivalent of an additional 29 percent on top of the traffic to our own web site.

> Among the literally thousands of sites that have reprinted ProPublica stories in 2012 alone are Ars Technica, the Atlantic Wire, CBS News, the Charlotte Observer, the Chronicle of Higher Education, the Cleveland Plain Dealer, Foreign Policy, the Houston Chronicle, the Huffington Post, the Las Vegas Sun, the Los Angeles Times, the Miami Herald, MinnPost, Minnesota Public Radio, Mother Jones, MSNBC, Nature, NBCNews.com, the Newark Star-Ledger, the New Haven Register, the New York Daily News, Nieman Journalism Lab, the San Jose Mercury News, Scientific American, the Seattle Times, Slate, Talking Points Memo, the Tampa Bay Times, the Trentonian, USA Today, the Utne Reader, Wired and Yahoo News.

> Why do we do this? ProPublica's mission is for our journalism to have impact, that is for it to spur reform. Greater reach -- the widest possible audience -- doesn’t equate to impact, but it can help, and certainly doesn’t hurt. So we encourage it. And, of course, we started in 2008 with almost no audience or reputation at all, and needed -- and still need -- to increase the circle of people who know us, and our work. CC helps us achieve that goal.

ProPublica also makes sure it can track the impact of any stories that are distributed under the Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International [Creative Commons license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/). This is really important, because it allows ProPublica to keep track of how their stories are being disseminated and include numbers from their republished material in reports that go out to funders and their Boards. As Tofel and Klein note:

> We created a simple JavaScript beacon that we call [Pixel Ping](http://www.propublica.org/about/pixelping). We designed it, working with developers at DocumentCloud, to be as lightweight as possible and so that it doesn’t violate, either in spirit or letter, the privacy policies of the sites that republish our work. Pixel Ping simply counts the number of times our stories are read on sites that republish them. It doesn’t collect any information about visitors, and it neither sets nor reads browser cookies. It’s [open source](http://documentcloud.github.io/pixel-ping/), too.

I am not advocating that NPR or member stations release all of their content under a Creative Commons license. This would destroy NPR's business model, which is currently based, in part, on member stations' paying dues to broadcast their programming. But for breaking news and investigative pieces — which are designed to have impact and spur change - doesn't it make sense for the stories to reach the biggest audience possible?

I say breaking news because 




In this essay, I explain why it would benefit public media as a system to

a) build its software on open source platforms and release it from day one as open source software 
b) publish all breaking news and investigative journalism content under 

This essay will be broken into three sections: first, explaining what public media's mission is, and the background and inspiration for this thought exercise; second, explaining why creating open source products and creative commons content would help fulfill public media's mission, and third, explaining why creating content in the open would strengthen public media in the United States.

## Background and Inspiration

The mission of public media is to provide programs and services that inform, educate, enlighten, and enrich the public. What differentiates public media from commercial media is that its primary goal is to serve the public, and not consumers. The Corporation for Public Broadcasting works with non-commercial educational telecommunications licensees across America 

ensure universal access, over-the-air and online, to high-quality content and telecommunications services that are commercial free and free of charge



4. From an [FCC report on non-profit media](http://transition.fcc.gov/osp/inc-report/INoC-31-Nonprofit-Media.pdf): 

>If a tech fund systematically unleashes open source software applications and the technology needed to operate them, and grants money for code, coders and computers to news organizations across the country, *it could spread public media innovation faster into new groups and deeper into existing ones, and create nothing less than a news renaissance in America.*

>“Everyone can win here. *A local newspaper, a commercial or public broadcaster, ethnic and alternative media, citizen media, new web-based startups, all of them can use open source news technology. The technology does not care whether they are liberal or conservative, old or young, city dwellers or rural Americans, black or white or any color of the rainbow.* People will still be free to choose what news they would like to consume; they will, in fact, have greater choice in a media ecosystem richer in local media.

And:

> Stations are free to collaborate, but neither CPB funding criteria, FCC licensing criteria, nor other national institutional strictures have incentivized them to do so. Indeed, some station managers seem to believe that collaboration will
hurt their ability to distinguish themselves in the community and attract funding. 

> What will “infrastructure” mean in the future? Basic infrastructure will no longer be limited to radio towers and satellite dishes, but will involve software, digital platforms, digital delivery systems, and applications. 


### Thesis Statement








*Why creating open source products and creative commons content are part of the key to fulfilling this mission*

2. Open source software is software that does not charge users a purchase or licensing fee for modifying or redistributing the source code, in our projects and contribute back to the open source community.

3. Creating free or open source software is particularly suitable for rapid prototyping and experimentation. The testing process generates minimal costs, and the process encourages the identification and elimination of defects not recognized by the original development team.

Free or open source software also Community involvement. Publicly available source code enables continuous and broad peer review. Whether simply publishing the completed code or opening the development process, the practice of expanding the review and testing process to a wider audience—beyond the development team—ensures increased software reliability and security. Developing in the open also allows for other opinions to help adjust the direction of a product to maximize its usefulness to the community it serves.

Cost-savings. The ability to modify FOSS enables 18F to respond rapidly to changing missions and markets. Support and maintenance of open source code—as opposed to more burdensome usages of proprietary software—provides a real cost advantage where multiple copies of software are required, or when the user base grows. The total cost of ownership is shared with a community, rather than solely 18F.

Reusability. The code we create belongs to the American people as a part of the public domain. The code we work on was paid for by the American people, but the end-product is not the only way they should be able to interact with their government. By coding in FOSS, we help populate a larger commons that cities, states, businesses, and citizens can participate in. This creates real economic value by lowering the burden of replicating similar work or by allowing the private sector to build off of and create new businesses around code developed at 18F.





3. Some public radio stations make [some of their software open source](https://github.com/melodykramer/PublicMedia#repos). This is done on an ad-hoc basis. 


Inspiration

1. From [NPR's original mission statement](http://current.org/2012/05/national-public-radio-purposes/): "The total service should be trustworthy, enhance intellectual development, expand knowledge, deepen aural esthetic enjoyment, increase the pleasure of living in a pluralistic society and result in a *service to listeners* which makes them more responsive, informed human beings and intelligent responsible citizens of their communities and the world....National Public Radio *will not regard its audience as a "market" or in terms of its disposable income, but as curious, complex individuals who are looking for some understanding, meaning and joy in the human experience.*"

2. From [a 2012 speech](http://current.org/2012/06/14260/) by Jay Allison: "For many of us, for some important core of us, public radio is a calling. *We believe in a civic responsibility and in civil behavior.* That’s a precious combination, because it’s increasingly rare. Our listeners know this about us. It’s why they trust us. And it’s why people want to join our cause — as supporters and participants...We should seek out our likely collaborators. Build partnerships with other groups who have kinship with us: arts groups, civic organizations, schools, museums, social services, all the nonprofits involved in making our places better. *We can act as a key connector in community*."

3. From [a 2005 Ford Foundation report prepared by the Public Media ThinkTank at American University](http://current.org/2005/09/what-makes-public-broadcasting-public-is-engagement/): 

> Public engagement is the heart of public broadcasting — and the best argument why taxpayers as well as donors and foundations need to support their public media.

> Public media are media whose mission is to serve, build and nurture an informed, engaged public. They include pubcasting stations, cable-access centers, DBS set-aside channels, low-power stations and even media arts organizations and museums.

> Even commercial media — such as judicious journalism or commercial cable’s prestige projects — sometimes fulfill public missions.

> Some public media are big institutions; some are so informal that they come out of people’s living rooms. *What they have in common is that they serve and need the public.* That makes them different from other media, which serve and need customers.

Also from the [2005 Ford Foundation report](http://current.org/2005/09/what-makes-public-broadcasting-public-is-engagement/): 

> "*Putting the project of public engagement at the center of public media addresses several nagging problems for broadcasters.* It shows why public broadcasters are different from other media that may be noncommercial but not necessarily public — for instance media produced by religious groups or nonprofits. It also shows the difference between having lots of information (which generates media smog) and having information that matters.

>Putting the public in the center also demonstrates how public broadcasting is a nonpartisan and unapologetically vigorous advocate of public life. It’s the exit from the squirrel-cage discussion of fairness and balance. As members of the public, we need to know more about the underlying problems of our society and government."
