I'm in the process of writing an essay right now.

The basic question I'm trying to answer is this: What is the purpose of a local public radio or TV station? 

I'm writing the essay because in recent days, several very smart people have asked me to articulate why local stations should exist. As you probably know, a national network - or even a station in a very larger city - can reach a very wide audience.

So what's the purpose of a local station? Are they relevant? Should they exist? How local is local? Does the purpose change if you get all of your news online? Why or why not? Do you care if local reporters live where you are? (An additional question: What sized community do you live in?) Are local reporters missing stories? Are national reporters? What's being missed? 

(I'm writing these questions knowing what I think, but would love to get your insights.)

PS: If you don't believe it's necessary to have a local station, I'd love to know that as well.
PPS: Please forward this to everyone you know. The more, the merrier.
