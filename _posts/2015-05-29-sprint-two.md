I have been remiss in posting what has been accomplished, mainly because I have been so busy trying to get everything done.

Here's what was accomplished from May 17-May 29 for [Media Public](melodykramer.github.io/mediapublic/).

1. Gave [a presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1bYqk1JpzajJl6guDcS7LLadPqTiX9e8p0ZSH5sB50AY/edit?usp=sharing) to the Nieman Fellows on the project.

2. Signed up 10 pilot stations for project.

3. Spoke with two people from Code for America about how they structured their earliest days, got buy-in from cities, and got projects off the ground.

4. Chatted with former CTO of the White House, who is now at the Kennedy School of Government.

5. Spoke with a librarian who is doing really innovative and creative things. Met with the [Harvard Library Innovation Lab](librarylab.law.harvard.edu/projects.html) about their work.

6. Attended a workshop on how to disseminate information without the Internet.

7. Had dinner with two old friends. A visited for a weekend. Played with some babies. Didn't work out as much as I would have liked. Ate really good Italian food.

 8. Applied for a Knight Prototype Grant to adapt [Midas](https://midas-dev.18f.us) for station use.

 9. Wrote an essay about [Creative Commons and public media](http://current.org/2015/05/why-more-public-media-content-should-be-licensed-under-creative-commons/). Wrote an [essay](http://www.niemanlab.org/2015/05/what-exactly-does-it-mean-to-be-a-member-of-a-public-radio-station-can-that-definition-expand/) about the project. Started another essay on open source and public media.

 10. Wrote 1,041 emails related to project.

 11. Started another essay on the importance of local journalism.

 12. Finished conducting user research.

 13. Sketched out designs for website to house all of this stuff.

 14. Contacted designers for help and advice

 15. Started, with the help of 11 people on the Internet, to create a station API for public use. Would allow people to surface things like "Show me all of the science reporters in public media" and/or "Show me the last 5 pieces published by Station X"

 16. Presented to the Civic Media group at MIT and a group of people at WGBH

 **What is Next!**

 1. Working with volunteer designers to create a prototype of the website for all of this stuff.

 2. Find funding.

 3. Continue to work with stations on the membership stuff

 4. Giving a presentation to Berkman Center on Tuesday

 5. Need mentors. I feel really lost and like I'm just swimming. I think I can articulate an MVP and priorities. I would like advice.

 6. Writing up all of the case studies and interviews I've conducted.

 7. Write up playbook for stations.

 8. Collapse into heap and hug my dog.
